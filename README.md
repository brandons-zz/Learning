# Learning

This repo is for content as I learn it, or need a sandbox to play in as I figure new things out. The majority of this content will be sync'd from Atom and may or may not contain bugs.

Since this is a learning repo - expect copypasta and who knows what else.

## HTML Personal Site

This content is from the UDEMY course Complete Web Development Bootcamp.
